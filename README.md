Automagic Weatherator

=====================

Domain determined simplified weather information.

## Then
This started as the overly simplistic XML scraper I built to power the wunderful [isitsnowinginpdx.com](http://www.isitsnowinginpdx.com) novelty site. That original iteration was built in 20 minutes and has sat untouched for 2 1/2 years entertaining Portlanders and non-Portlanders alike.

## Now
In a quest to get away from the seriousness that most of my time in an IDE entails, I decided to build upon this original code and make something twice as fun with it.

# How to deploy
* Setup your favorite stack configured with PHP (recommended 4+)
* Stick this index.php in whatever directory you choose.
* ```mkdir cachey``` in the parent dir of the index.php to create the cache dir.
* Do something with permissions so it works.
* Enjoy.
